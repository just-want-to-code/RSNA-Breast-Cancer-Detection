    "\n",
    "**12/04**: I find myself in the spot so often encountered by DL practitioners -- the model simply doesn't train! Or rather, it trains poorly to the point where one cannot be certain to what extent it is making good use of the available information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interesting case as a lot can be happening. From what I observed on the forums (special thanks go to Theo Viel and his awesome notebook: [RSNA Breast Baseline - Inference](https://www.kaggle.com/code/theoviel/rsna-breast-baseline-inference), now there is also [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hengck23/notebooke04a738685) by hengck23), people are feeding the data to their model in a way that I wouldn't expect. Theo is only normalizing it to between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this might mean that some important information to the model is lost in the processing that I do here. Or it could be a hunderd of other small things the community has arrived at through so many RSNA competitions üôÇ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three things to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "* explore various ways of phrsing the problem within `fastai` (training with Sigmoid, Softmax, etc)\n",
    "* get the pipeline on Kaggle working with what I have\n",
    "    * to always have a working pipeline version (otherwise it is very easy to lose momentum on a project)\n",
    "    * to be verifying if local improvements generalize to LB (so far, I have a very weak handle on what is going on in this competition, the more data I collect the better)\n",
    "* after the above, see what happens if I feed data to my model either how Theo or hengck23 does it (normalized to [0,1], zero-centered and standard dev normalized)\n",

    "I replaced the training loop, how data is read, the data I am reading, added a metric from `torchmetrics` for another bit of sanity check and also did a couple of things that don't make sense but you essentially question everything when stuff doesn't train. The things I tried that didn't make much sense was training on larger images (why 512px should work if 256px doesn't train reasonably?) and training with sigmoid and BCE vs softmax and nll (with two classes they should be equivalent). Oh yeah, I also tried different models of course, directly from fast.ai, the one from Theo, pretrained, not pretrained, etc.\n",
